# C - Static libraries

This directory includes an archive file with object files that are to be linked to programs that require them. 

- The prototypes of the object files are in the [main.h](./main.h) file.

- The script [create_static_lib.sh](./create_static_lib.sh) automatically creates a library for the object files in the current directory.
